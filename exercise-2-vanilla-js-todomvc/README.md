# Debugging JavaScript, Exercise 2

## TodoMVC Vanilla JS

### Difficulty: Easy

The (todomvc/vanilla) folder contains a clone of the basic Vanilla JS example from [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com), but with a bug for you to find.

The bug leaves some obvious clues, but do you understand what the clues are telling you?

## How To Run the App
- `cd todomvc/vanillajs`
- `npm ci`
- `npm start`

## Debugging Instructions

If this app was working correctly, once you run `npm start` and your browser opens to http://localhost:8080, then you would see a fully functional TodoMVC app, that looks and works just like http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/. You should be able to add, edit, complete, delete, and filter todo's, and they should persist in local storage when you refresh the page.

This app doesn't work as expected, because I broke it, just for you, so you can practice your awesome debugging skills.

I can add, edit, complete, and delete todo's. However, when I try to filter the list, I can view 'all' or 'completed', but not 'active'.

Can you get it working again?

## Hints

- There is a console error, but this one's more complicated than a simple typo.
- This type of error could result from some poor copy/pasting, or from forgetting a step during a refactoring effort.
- It's still not a logic error, just a simple omission.
