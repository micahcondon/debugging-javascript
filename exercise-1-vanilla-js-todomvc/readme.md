# Debugging JavaScript, Exercise 1

## TodoMVC Vanilla JS

### Difficulty: Easy

The (todomvc/vanilla) folder contains a clone of the basic Vanilla JS example from [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com), but with a few bugs for you to find.

Each of the bugs leaves some obvious clues, but do you understand what the clues are telling you?

## How To Run the App
- `cd todomvc/vanillajs`
- `npm ci`
- `npm start`

## Debugging Instructions

If this app was working correctly, once you run `npm start` and your browser opens to http://localhost:8080, then you would see a fully functional TodoMVC app, that looks and works just like http://todomvc.com/examples/vanillajs/. You should be able to add, edit, complete, delete, and filter todo's, and they should persist in local storage when you refresh the page.

This app doesn't work as expected, because I broke it, just for you, so you can practice your awesome debugging skills.

When I open the app in my browser, I can see some things, but it doesn't look pretty like it should, and I cannot add any todo's.

Can you get it working again?

## Hints

- For the first bug, there are no console errors, but there are some visual clues.
- For the second bug, the console error tells you all that you need to know!
- For the third bug, you'll need to work a little harder to connect the dots, but the console error is a major clue.
- Each bug is the result of a simple typing mistake, not an error in logic.
