# Debugging JavaScript, Exercise 1

## TodoMVC Vanilla JS

### Difficulty: Easy

How are your JS debugging skills?

The (todomvc/vanilla) folder contains a clone of the basic Vanilla JS example from [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com), but with a couple bugs for you to find.

Both of the bugs leave some obvious clues, but one may be more obvious than the other!

## How To Run the App
- `npm ci`
- `npm start`

## Debugging Instructions

If this app was working correctly, once you run `npm start` and your browser opens to (http://localhost:8080), then you would see a full working TodoMVC app.

You should be able to add, edit, complete, delete, and filter todo's, and they should persist in local storage when you refresh the page.

That doesn't happen, because I broke it, just for you, so you can practice your awesome debugging skills.

Can you get it working again?
